 abstract = {This paper generalizes the iterated greedy algorithm to solve a multi-objective facility location problem known as the Bi-objective p-Center and p-Dispersion problem (    B p C D    ). The new algorithm is coined as Multi-objective Parallel Iterated Greedy (MoPIG) and optimizes more than one objective at the same time. The     B p C D     seeks to locate p facilities to service or cover a set of n demand points, and the goal is to minimize the maximum distance between facilities and demand points and, at the same time, maximize the minimum distance between all pairs of selected facilities. Computational results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm over the evolutionary algorithms NSGA-II, MOEA/D, and the Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm 2 (SPEA2), comparing them with the optimal solution found by the    ϵ   -constraint method.},
