Graduated in the Double Degree in Computer Science and Software Engineering at the Universidad Rey Juan Carlos, Móstoles campus (ETSII) with an average final mark of 8.17 points. Master in ICT Security at the UOC, with a final average mark of 9,16 points. I am passionate about programming, in fact, I participate in some programming competitions at university level and I currently train teams to participate in competitions at regional level. I like to work as a team and help my classmates as much as possible, and I try to learn something new from each person I meet and expand my knowledge. Another field that I am very interested in is cybersecurity. I love to keep up to date with new technologies and scientific advances. I am currently working as a university researcher at the Universidad Rey Juan Carlos in the area of optimization, heuristics and metaheuristics, preparing my doctoral thesis. Specifically, I do research in the [GRAFO group](https://grafo.etsii.urjc.es/). Research recognitions:


*    Award for best student paper at the CiDReS congress [(CAEPIA 2018)](https://sci2s.ugr.es/caepia18/inicio.html)

I write and edit a blog together with [Enrique García Galán](https://www.linkedin.com/in/enrique-garciag/) about computing in general, although most of the contents published are about web technologies and cybersecurity. The content is available at https://infseg.com

Official Programming Contests I have entered and obtained position:

*    2nd Place in [ADA-BYRON (UCM Contest)](http://ada-byron.es/2016/).
*    Participation in [SWERC 2016](https://swerc.eu/) at the University of Porto (Portugal) on behalf of the Rey Juan Carlos University
