abstract: Most of the critical infrastructures can be easily modeled as a network
  of nodes interconnected among them. If one or more nodes of the network fail, the
  connectivity of the network can be compromised, to the point of completely disconnecting
  the network. Additionally, disconnecting the network can result in cascade failures,
  because the remaining nodes may be overloaded because of heavy traffic in the network.
  One of the main objectives of an attacker is to isolate the nodes whose removal
  disconnect the network in minimum size subnetworks. On the contrary, a defender
  must identify those weak points in order to maintain the network integrity. This
  work is focused on solving the $$ backslashalpha $$$α$separator problem, whose main
  objective is to find a minimum set of nodes that disconnect a network in isolated
  subnetworks of size smaller than a given value. The problem is tackled from a metaheuristic
  point of view, analyzing the solutions given by a Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search
  Procedure over different network topologies. The results obtained are compared with
  the best algorithm found in the literature.
