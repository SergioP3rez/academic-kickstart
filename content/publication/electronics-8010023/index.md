abstract: Community detection in social networks is becoming one of the key tasks
  in social network analysis, since it helps with analyzing groups of users with similar
  interests. As a consequence, it is possible to detect radicalism or even reduce
  the size of the data to be analyzed, among other applications. This paper presents
  a metaheuristic approach based on Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP)
  methodology for detecting communities in social networks. The community detection
  problem is modeled as an optimization problem, where the objective function to be
  optimized is the modularity of the network, a well-known metric in this scientific
  field. The results obtained outperform classical methods of community detection
  over a set of real-life instances with respect to the quality of the communities
  detected.
