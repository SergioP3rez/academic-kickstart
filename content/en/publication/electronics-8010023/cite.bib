 abstract = {Community detection in social networks is becoming one of the key tasks in social network analysis, since it helps with analyzing groups of users with similar interests. As a consequence, it is possible to detect radicalism or even reduce the size of the data to be analyzed, among other applications. This paper presents a metaheuristic approach based on Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP) methodology for detecting communities in social networks. The community detection problem is modeled as an optimization problem, where the objective function to be optimized is the modularity of the network, a well-known metric in this scientific field. The results obtained outperform classical methods of community detection over a set of real-life instances with respect to the quality of the communities detected.},
