abstract: This paper generalizes the iterated greedy algorithm to solve a multi-objective
  facility location problem known as the Bi-objective p-Center and p-Dispersion problem
  (    B p C D    ). The new algorithm is coined as Multi-objective Parallel Iterated
  Greedy (MoPIG) and optimizes more than one objective at the same time. The     B
  p C D     seeks to locate p facilities to service or cover a set of n demand points,
  and the goal is to minimize the maximum distance between facilities and demand points
  and, at the same time, maximize the minimum distance between all pairs of selected
  facilities. Computational results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
  algorithm over the evolutionary algorithms NSGA-II, MOEA/D, and the Strength Pareto
  Evolutionary Algorithm 2 (SPEA2), comparing them with the optimal solution found
  by the    ϵ   -constraint method.
