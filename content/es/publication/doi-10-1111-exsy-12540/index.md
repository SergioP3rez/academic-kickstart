abstract: Abstract In recent years, the relevance of cybersecurity has been increasingly
  evident to companies and institutions, as well as to final users. Because of that,
  it is important to ensure the robustness of a network. With the aim of improving
  the security of the network, it is desirable to find out which are the most critical
  nodes in order to protect them from external attackers. This work tackles this problem,
  named the α-separator problem, from a heuristic perspective, proposing an algorithm
  based on the Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP). In particular,
  a novel approach for the constructive procedure is proposed, where centrality metrics
  derived from social network analysis are used as a greedy criterion. Furthermore,
  the quality of the provided solutions is improved by means of a combination method
  based on Path Relinking (PR). This work explores different variants of PR, also
  adapting the most recent one, Exterior PR, for the problem under consideration.
  The combination of GRASP + PR allows the algorithm to obtain high-quality solutions
  within a reasonable computing time. The proposal is supported by a set of intensive
  computational experiments that show the quality of the proposal, comparing it with
  the most competitive algorithm found in the state of art.
